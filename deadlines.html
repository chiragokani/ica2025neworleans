<ul>
<li>Date (to be discussed with Jorge Arenas):  The Board of the International Commission for Acoustics (ICA) has established the ICA Young Scientist Conference Attendance Grants (YS Grants) Program to help young acousticians to attend the Congress in New Orleans. Each grant is up to 500 USD, from which a portion will be used to cover the conference registration and the remainder provided in US dollars at the time of the conference.  The receipt of the award of the prestigious YS Grant may be used by the young acoustician to assist with obtaining additional funding from other sources.  Candidates must be under 35 years of age on the day of the opening ceremony of the Congress and may be either undergraduate or postgraduate students, postdoctoral or young acousticians.  Special consideration will be given to applicants from developing countries.</li>
